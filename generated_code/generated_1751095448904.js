To create a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python, you just need to use the `print()` function. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

You can run this code in any Python environment, such as an IDE (like PyCharm or VSCode), a text editor (like Sublime Text or Atom), or an online Python interpreter.
