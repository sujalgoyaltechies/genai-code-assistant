To create a simple "Hello, World!" application in Node.js, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Create a new directory for your project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir hello-world
   cd hello-world
   ```

3. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
   This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.

4. **Create a new JavaScript file**: Create a file named `app.js` (or whatever you prefer) in your project directory.

5. **Write the "Hello, World!" code**: Open `app.js` in your preferred text editor and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

6. **Run the application**: In your terminal, execute the following command to run your Node.js application:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

7. **See the output**: You should see the following output in your terminal:

   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

That's it! You've successfully created and run a simple "Hello, World!" program in Node.js.
