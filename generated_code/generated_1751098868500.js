To create a simple "Hello, World!" application in Node.js, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't installed Node.js yet, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and install it on your machine.

2. **Create a new directory for your project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir hello-world
   cd hello-world
   ```

3. **Initialize a new Node.js project** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Create a JavaScript file**: Create a file named `app.js` (or any name you prefer):
   ```bash
   touch app.js
   ```

5. **Open `app.js` in a text editor** and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   console.log('Hello, World!');
   ```

6. **Run your application**: In your terminal, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

7. **Output**: You should see the following output in your terminal:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

That's it! You've created a simple "Hello, World!" application in Node.js. If you want to expand this further, you can create a web server or explore other features of Node.js.
