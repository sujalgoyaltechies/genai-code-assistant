To create a simple "Hello, World!" application in Node.js, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new directory for your project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir hello-world
   cd hello-world
   ```

3. **Create a new JavaScript file**: You can name it `app.js` or `index.js`.
   ```bash
   touch app.js
   ```

4. **Open the file in your favorite text editor** and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```

5. **Run the application**: Use Node.js to run your JavaScript file.
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```

That's it! You've created a simple "Hello, World!" program in Node.js. If you have any further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!
