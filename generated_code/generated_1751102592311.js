Certainly! Hereâ€™s a simple "Hello, World!" function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Call the function
sayHello();
```

When you run this code, it will output "Hello, World!" to the console. You can place this code in a JavaScript file or in the console of your web browser to see it in action.
